# Spotify-Genre-Predicting-Model
## Code-Pudding-Sept-24

## Description
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a song using various metrics provided by Spotify. The goal is to create a predictive model that can  classify the genre of a song based on its features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and other characteristics.  Spotify API is used to retrieve these song metrics for a new track and make predictions on new songs.

## Setup Instructions

## Data Project
### Workflow:
1. Collect Data
    
    Build a dataset within Spotify

2. Preprocess Data:

    Clean and preprocess dataset for model training.
3. Train Models:
    
    Train models using the audio metrics as features and genre as target.
    
    Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, F1-score).
4. Evaluate Model Performance:

    Check for the effectiveness of the model. Analyze predictions.
5. Integrate Spotify API:
    
6. Make Predictions on New Songs:
    
    Trained a machine learning model to predicts the genre of a new song based on its Spotify audio features.
