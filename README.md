# Spotify-Genre-Predicting-Model
## Code-Pudding-Sept-24

## Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a song using various metrics provided by Spotify. The goal is to create a predictive model that can  classify the genre of a song based on its features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and other characteristics. Additionally, this project will use the Spotify API to retrieve these song metrics for any new track, allowing us to make predictions on new songs.

## Setup Instructions

## Data Project
### Workflow:
1. Collect Data
    
    Build a dataset within Spotify

2. Preprocess Data:

    Clean and preprocess dataset for model training.
3. Train Models:
    
    Train models using the audio metrics as features and genre as target.
    
    Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, F1-score).
4. Evaluate Model Performance:

    Check for the effectiveness of the model. Analyze predictions.
5. Integrate Spotify API:
    
6. Make Predictions on New Songs:
    
    Use the trained machine learning model to predict the genre of any new song based on its Spotify audio features.
